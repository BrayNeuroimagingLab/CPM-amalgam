* Han Fang: pip installation for glmnet_py

* Kaushik Putta kputta: 
Found a bug with the cvglmnet error bars causing incorrect cross-validation error bars (biased larger than they should be). 
This was caused by an overwrite of weights during pass by reference in the fortran solver.
Fixed with a patch to glmnet.py on Dec 5, 2019.
